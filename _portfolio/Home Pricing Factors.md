This presentation analyzes the factors that drive home prices by providing data-driven insights for an investment bank. Variables that provide impact on prices will be identified in order to provide informed decisions on how to allocate dollars earmarked for investment into mortgage-backed securities.  

## About the Data

This data set was a sample of 1,460 houses that were sold between 2006 and 2010 in Ames, Iowa.

There are 81 columns with a good distribution between numerical and categorical data.

This data was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Research Questions

1. What factors influence the selling price of a home? (characteristics such as quality, number of bedrooms, etc.)
2. Which type of homes are most frequently sold in the market; is there a relationship between the age or condition and their selling prices?
3. Are there any observable patterns or trends indicating which combinations of home types and neighborhoods attract the highest number of buyers/selling price?
4. Do certain neighborhoods have higher home prices compared to others?

## Methods

Find correlations between numerical data and the housing sale price

Used descriptive statistics, A/B testing with t-tests, PivotTables, and PivotCharts to provide insights into central tendencies and relationships between variables.

Assess the quality of the data, handling missing values, and detecting outliers.

Incorporate visualizations to identify patterns and relationships with data.

## Methods Explained

This project was done using Excel, splitting data into treatment and control groups, while utilizing pivot tables and the Data Analysis ToolPak to manipulate data.

Based on insights from using Exploratory Data Analysis, new columns of data were created in order to get the proper data needed for t-tests.

Confidence intervals were also calculated for the hypotheses in order to accept or reject the null.
