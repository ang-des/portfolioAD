Here is a simple visual comparing the profits of each of the calculated strategies compared to the current data pulled from 2018.

This visual shows the breakdown of the profits including the Total Revenue, Total Costs, including insurance, and the Total Profits made. Strategy 1 and 2 are close together in numbers, but you can see that Strategy 1 is just above Strategy 2. And although Strategy 3 made a lower revenue, the costs were significantly lower compared to the other strategies and almost the same as the baseline data from 2018, which results in Strategy 3 having a higher profit altogether.

</p>

All calculations were done using 25% of the current vehicle inventory or 25% of the current number of rentals to ensure a more accurate comparison.

The better recommendation would be Strategy 3, to remove (x) number of vehicles that bring in the lowest net revenue and replace them with an (x) number of vehicles that bring in the highest net revenue.
